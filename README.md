Kubernetes with Jkube Sample
======

It is a basic java project using Jkube to build and deploy a project on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

Motivation
------

I couldn't find any documentation or demo explaining how to configure HPA using JKube.

This project is a sample of how to configure and deploy a project with HPA on a local or remote cluster.
